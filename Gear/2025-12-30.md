# Fwd
This is the gear I've collected so far about a month ahead of departure. I need to pick up a few smaller things and might swap some of the more critical pieces before I leave but I'll make an updated list similar to this in Feb to compare. My overall gear philosophy is that if I need to be doing hours of research and shelling out thousands of dollars in order to be prepared to "walk forward into woods," then I'd rather just die out there. This shit is cheap, mostly from Amazon, poorly researched, and likely to fail in many places. I will make due with what I can. I am not aiming to hit the optimal comfort level out there. I am not going to be making 80 YouTube shorts comparing 80 different options for things. I am going to walk into woods.

# Shelter
I am choosing to hammock as much as I can. I get really good sleep in a hammock I've found, and I've been able to set it up on the ground under a pitched tarp too so I still have some flexibility. 

#### QEVOON Hammock
https://a.co/d/9ggLXDP

This is a cheapo all caps mystery brand hammock Amazon. I've slept easily 20+ nights in this so far and don't really have any complaints, but I might swap this out at the last minute for a blackbird or something else I'd "trust" more, since replacing this on the trail will be a pain.

#### Wise Owl Tarp
https://a.co/d/5iltQck

Again with a cheapo mystery brand. It's a tarp. It has worked well so far. Before I got this I started printing some plastic guy line tensioners but this came with some already attached.

# Sleep

#### Sensory4U Down Top Quilt
https://a.co/d/dJ2UiTT

I did initially try going sleeping bag in hammock and it was a pain as expected. This quilt has been real solid tho and I've been very comfortable with it in ~40F sleeps.

#### Hikenture Sleeping Pad
https://a.co/d/gjXeXib

This is coming in a week so I haven't tried it yet but it hasn't been cold enough to really need a pad in the hammock until just now. Mainly I want this so that if I have to take the hammock to the ground I can.

# Clothing
#### Iguana Merino Base Layer
https://a.co/d/b4qaM1E

I've never been out somewhere long/cold enough where a base layer like this was actually necessary it feels like, but with the recent cold front in I've tried this out and it is p comfy. 

#### Saucony Tr14 Trail Runners
https://a.co/d/4Wn7sg4

These are a likely last minute swap. I mostly wanted something that would last through some initial shakedowns down here and also my vans were falling apart pretty hard. These seem fine so far and I've put easily 100+ miles on them by now but I suspect they disintegrate pretty quickly.

#### Darn Tough Socks
https://a.co/d/hgnPaxf

These things own. 

#### Uniqlo Beanie

I bought this in the times square Uniqlo. Times Square sucks, don't go there. I don't know why I was there. Not important.

# Pack
# Others
#### Cascade Mountain Trek Poles
https://a.co/d/8AC26DA

I fucking *hate* trekking poles. I don't know why really but not having my hands free while I'm hiking feels absolutely miserable to me. I'm sure this is part of why my spine is rapidly liquifying but whatever. Maybe this trip will change my mind on them but mostly I'm nabbing some cheap ones so that I can have something reliable to setup a ground shelter with if needed.

#### InReach Mini
https://a.co/d/8NPES8H

GPS miiiight come in handy. Might be cool to see if I can route check-ins via the satellite. Mostly just want the SOS button so people aren't worried about me dying in some real slow and painful manner.

#### LHKNL Rechargeable Headlamp
https://a.co/d/4laPd3j

Opting for rechargeable rather than batteries since I'll have portable batteries. It is a headlamp.
