Cold front in. 
Gave blood for the last time in a while probably.
Allergies real bad but managed to clock 15 miles walking thru some errands.
Need to catalog gear tomorrow.
Been sleeping on the porch as much as I can but the wind is really fucking up my ability to do anything because I have almost zero solid spots to tie down a tarp.
